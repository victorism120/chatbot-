# chatbot-
## Description
This project implements a simple conversational AI chatbot using a pre-trained GPT model (GPT-2) from Hugging Face. The chatbot generates responses based on user input and can be fine-tuned for domain-specific applications.

## Installation
### Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- `transformers` library
- `torch`

To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

## Usage
Run the chatbot script with:
```bash
python chatbot.py
```
Type your message, and the chatbot will respond. Type `exit` to stop the conversation.

## Customization
- Modify the `MODEL_NAME` variable to use different GPT-based models.
- Adjust `temperature` and `max_length` in `generate_response()` to control response creativity and length.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical interface using Streamlit.
- Integrate with external APIs for better factual accuracy.
- Deploy as a web-based chatbot or API service.
